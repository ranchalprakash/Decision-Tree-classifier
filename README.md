# Decision-Tree-classifier
Classification of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer(WDBC) dataset using Decision Tree classifier
Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer(WDBC) dataset from the UCI repository.
Each row in the dataset represents a sample of biopsied tissue. The tissue for each sample is
imaged and 10 characteristics of the nuclei of cells present in each image are characterized. These
characteristics are: Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, Number
of concave portions of contour, Symmetry, Fractal dimension. Each sample used in the dataset
is a feature vector of length 30. The first 10 entries in this feature vector are the mean of the characteristics
listed above for each image. The second 10 are the standard deviation and last 10 are the
largest value of each of these characteristics present in each image.
• Training data: ‘ trainX.csv 0
consisting of 455 samples, 30 attributes. The label associated
with each sample is provided in ‘ trainY.csv 0
. A label of value 1 indicates the sample was
for malignant (cancerous) tissue, 0 indicates the sample was for benign tissue. .
• Test data: ‘ testX.csv 0
consisting of 57 samples, 30 attributes. The label associated with
each sample is provided in ‘ testY.csv 0
.
